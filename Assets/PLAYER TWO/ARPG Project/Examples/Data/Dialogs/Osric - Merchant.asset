      a merchant, you see. Once, I was a traveler like yourself, peddling wares from
      city to city, from the grand markets of Eldoria to the hidden bazaars of the
      Shadow Coast. But, let\u2019s just say\u2026 circumstances led me to settle
      down here. A few too many enemies, a few too many debts, and well\u2026 Ashenvale
      is a good place to disappear for a while."

      more than what the common folk peddle in the daylight. You\u2019re not just
      another farmer looking for a new plow, nor some weary traveler in need of dried
      rations. No, no\u2026 you\u2019re here because you seek something special.
      You see, friend, there are two kinds of merchants in this world. The first
      kind sells what they\u2019re told to sell\u2014grain, cloth, honest steel.
      Useful? Yes. But utterly predictable. "
