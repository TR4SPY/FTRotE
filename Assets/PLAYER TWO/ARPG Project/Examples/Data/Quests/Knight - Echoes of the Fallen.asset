  title: Echoes of the Fallen
  description: "Power is not granted. It is earned through trial, pain, and clarity
    of purpose.\n\nThere is one who walks in ruin - a knight once sworn to light,
    now bound in shadow. The Fallen Dark Knight. His presence corrupts the land.
    His soul, long lost\u2026 but not forgotten.\n\nYou must face him. Not to destroy
    what remains but to confront what you may become, should your path ever falter.\n\nBring
    me the {quest item} he carries. Only then will you be ready to take the next
    step.\n\nGo now. Let your resolve be stronger than his despair."
