# AI-DDA (Artificial Intelligence Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment)

This project explores the integration of machine learning techniques, specifically through Unity ML-Agents and potentially other AI models, to dynamically adjust the difficulty in an RPG game environment.

---

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an AI system capable of:
- Adapting game difficulty dynamically to suit the player's skill level and preferences.
- Enhancing player engagement by providing a tailored gaming experience.
- Leveraging advanced AI techniques for real-time player modeling and difficulty adjustment.

### **Current Status**
The project is built upon a heavily modified version of the **ARPG Project** asset and utilizes the **Gaia Pro 2023** terrain generation asset for an immersive environment. The game prototype currently focuses on integrating machine learning systems for AI-driven adaptations.

#### âœ” **Completed**

- **AI Agent Implementation**: AI can explore, interact with NPCs, fight enemies, and discover zones and waypoints.
- **Data Logging & Player Modeling**: System logs player and AI behavior (kills, deaths, interactions, exploration, etc.).
- **Bartleâ€™s Player Type Classification**: AI classifies players based on behavior (Achiever, Explorer, Socializer, Killer).
- **ML-Agents Integration**: AI functions within Unity ML-Agents for behavior learning.
- **Final DDA Implementation**: Prototype system for difficulty adjustment is in place.

#### ðŸš§ **In Progress**

- **Finalizing DDA Implementation**: AI should dynamically adjust difficulty based on player behavior.
- **Training AI Based on Player Data**: AI should learn from real players' behavior to adjust difficulty effectively.
- **Experiment Setup & Testing**: Two test groups:
Group A (DDA ON) â€“ AI adjusts difficulty dynamically
Group B (DDA OFF) â€“ Static difficulty
- **Optimizing Enemy AI Behavior**: Ensuring enemies behave correctly when AI Agent interacts with them.
- **Refinement of Player Modeling & Difficulty Scaling**

## **Technical Details**

### **Technology Stack**
- **Game Engine**: Unity (URP 6+)
- **ML Toolkit**: Unity ML-Agents
- **Assets**:
  - ARPG Project (heavily modified to fit the purpose of the project)
  - Gaia Pro 2023 (terrain generation and environment design)
- **Programming Languages**: C# (Unity), Python (for ML model training)

### **Core Components**
- **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)**: AI adapts enemy strength, spawn rates, and mechanics based on the player.
- **Player Modeling**: AI analyzes player interactions to classify playstyle.
- **Bartleâ€™s Player Types**: Comparison of player-declared vs. dynamically classified types.
- **ML-Agents Training**: AI learns to adjust game mechanics based on real player data.
- **Experimental Validation**: AI's impact on player experience is tested with two groups of participants.
