# AI-DDA (Artificial Intelligence Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment)

This project explores the integration of machine learning techniques, specifically through Unity ML-Agents and potentially other AI models, to dynamically adjust the difficulty in an RPG game environment.

---

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an AI system capable of:
- **Adapting game difficulty dynamically** to suit the player's skill level and preferences.
- Enhancing player engagement by providing a tailored gaming experience.
- Leveraging advanced AI techniques for real-time player modeling and difficulty adjustment.

### **Current Status**
The project is built upon a heavily modified version of the **ARPG Project** asset and utilizes the **Gaia Pro 2023** terrain generation asset for an immersive environment. The game prototype currently focuses on integrating machine learning systems for AI-driven adaptations.

Key features targeted in the final implementation:
1. **Bartle's Player Types Integration**: Adjusting gameplay mechanics based on the player's classification (e.g., achievers, explorers, socializers, and killers).
2. **AI Adaptation Based on Player Behavior**: Real-time player modeling to adjust difficulty metrics such as enemy strength, environment hazards, and quest complexity.
3. **Cooperative AI Companion**: Developing an AI-controlled companion that adapts to assist the player effectively.

## **Technical Details**

### **Technology Stack**
- **Game Engine**: Unity (URP 6+)
- **ML Toolkit**: Unity ML-Agents
- **Assets**:
  - ARPG Project (heavily modified)
  - Gaia Pro 2023 (terrain generation and environment design)
- **Programming Languages**: C# (Unity), Python (for ML model training)

### **AI Models and Methods**
- **ML-Agents**: Reinforcement learning agents for adaptive mechanics.
- **Player Modeling**: Techniques such as clustering and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to analyze player behavior.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Formulas and heuristics that dynamically adjust based on real-time gameplay data.

## **Future Work**
- Finalize AI integration with Unity ML-Agents.
- Expand on Bartleâ€™s player type modeling.
- Implement a detailed logging and feedback system for player data.
- Conduct user testing with two distinct groups: one experiencing AI-DDA and one with static difficulty settings.
